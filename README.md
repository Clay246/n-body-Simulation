# n-body-Simulation
My take at simulating the n-body problem using a simple numerical integration approach.

There are a few things to note:
 - the simulation is based entirely on Newtonian mechanics;
 - the reference frame from which the motion is being viewed is the center of mass reference frame;
 - the motion is planar, so that the motion takes place entirely in two dimensions;
 - gravity is turned off when the objects come too close together;
 - objects will never strike each other.
 
Many animations to be uploaded soon.
